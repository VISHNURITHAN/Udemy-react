# Udemy-react
Project Description
This project is a Udemy Clone built using React.js, HTML, and CSS. It aims to replicate the core functionality and design of the Udemy online learning platform, including course listings, individual course pages, and a responsive user interface.

The clone allows users to:

**View a list of available courses**
Access detailed information about each course (including description, instructor, and price)
Navigate through the platform via a clean and intuitive interface
Experience responsive design across various devices
Although it does not include full functionality such as payments or user accounts, it serves as a demonstration of front-end development skills using modern web technologies.

**Technologies Used**
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
HTML5: Markup language for structuring content
CSS3: Styling the interface with modern layout techniques

**Features**
Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
Course listing page with thumbnails and course details
Individual course pages with in-depth information
Modular, reusable components across the project
